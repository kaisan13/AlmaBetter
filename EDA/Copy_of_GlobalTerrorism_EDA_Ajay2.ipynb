        "In our team, their are two members and the names of our team members are Ajay Kumar Singh, Purnima Pandey. we are working together on Exploratory Data Analysis on the topic of Global Terrorism Dataset. We have decided to choose this project to find out hot zones of terrorism, security issues and key insights by ensuring through visualization.\"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation\".Generally, terrorism is defined as an unlawful use of violence designed to further political aims by creating fear. This means that it can be difficult to define which violent acts should be classified as terrorism, and cases where the perpetrator does not have a political motivation. Note that although this definition is adequate at a general level, it is too broad to operate as an internationally agreed legal definition. For example, it is not clear on the status of violence in wars of national liberation and self-determination. This lack of universal agreement has hampered the ability of the international community to coordinate efforts to combat terrorism.Terrorism is by no means just a 21st century issue, with attacks that could be described as terrorism dating back as far as the Roman Empire. As for the word ‘terrorism’, its usage emerges from the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution – although the fact that the violence was conducted by the state ironically means it likely does not qualify as terrorism. Turning to more modern times, looking at the number of terror attack victims in Western Europe since 1970 shows more victims in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 2000s. Much of this violence was enacted by nationalist movements such as the IRA or the ETA, as well as political extremists on both the left and right. Moreover, the 1970s and 1980s saw a range of high-profiled plane hijackings, for instance the hijacking of the Landshut between Spain and Germany in 1977, and the hijacking of the Air France flight that was redirected to Entebbe in Uganda in 1976. However, there has been a number of deadly terrorist attacks in Europe since the turn of the millennium, with seven of the 10 deadliest terrorist attacks on the continent happening since 2004.\n",

        "  The Global Terrorism Dataset(GTD) is a database on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 to 2017 containing over 180,000 attacks. Researchers at The National Consortium maintain the database for the Study Of Terrorism And Responses To Terrorism(START), headquartered at the \"University Of Maryland\". In this database there are 135 columns and 181,691 rows of different variables. The primary purpose of the project is to dive into generating visualizations, surrounding time and what they demonstrate. It had to focus on global bombings between 1970 to 2017, as of now attacks have become more deadly with the lethality rising by 26% and Islamic States(IS) and it affiliates remained the world's deadliest terrorist group for the eight consecutive years, with attacks in 21 countries and Islamic State, the deadliest, saw an increase of 12% to 2.9 deaths per attack, while al-Shabaab's lethality rate is at its highest level since 2017, if we look at Global Terrorism Index 2023, Afghanistan is the country which is mostly affected by terrorism in 2023 and India's rank is 13th globally. The hub of terrorism is rapidly changing and moving towards countries facing political instability, conflict and ecological degradation, particularly in the Sahel. Deaths from terrorism in the Sahel increased by 7% and are now higher than South Asia and Middle East and North Africa(MENA) combined. The area is also the most impacted region in the world, representing 43% of deaths from terrorism globally, this index is produced by The Institute For Economics And Piece(IEP), think tank, using data from terrorism tracker and other sources. Now, the next two deadliest terrorist groups are Balochistan Liberation Army(BLA) and Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam Wal Muslimeen(JNIM).\n",
